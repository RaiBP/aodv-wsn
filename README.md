# Ad-Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks
Contiki implementation of AODV routing, using the C programming language. Course project for the Wireless Sensor Networks course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Summer Semester 2021.

## Main features:
* Concieved as a low-resource network for small scale agricultural monitoring (i.e. greenhouses).
* Handles temperature and luminosity sensor data.
* GUI for network topology visualization.

## Acknowledgments
This repository is a modification of Andrea Milanta's own open source [implementation](https://github.com/AndreaMilanta/AODV).
